  <h3>Name of the song</h3> <h1><i> Wish You Were Here</i></h1>

  <h2>lyrics</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      So, so you think you can tell <br />
      Heaven from hell<br />
      skies from pain<br />
      Can you tell a green field<br />
       a cold steel rail?<br />
      A smile from a veil?
      you think you can tell?
  </div>
      <br>
  <div>
      Did they get you to trade<br />
      Your heroes for ghosts?
       ashes for trees?<br />
      Hot air for a cool breeze?
      Cold comfort for change?
      Did you exchange
      A walk on part in the war
      <span> <b>a lead role in a cage?</b></span>
      
  </div>
      <br>
  <div>
       I wish, how I wish you were here<br />
      We're just two lost souls<br />
      Swimming in a fish bowl<br />
      Year after year<br />
      Running over the same old ground<br />
      And how we found<br />
      The same old fears<br />
      Wish you were here
    </p>
  </div>
