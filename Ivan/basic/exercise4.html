    <h3>5 Reasons to Start Now</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><b> You’ll be in good company.</b></li>
      <p>
        Game of Thrones fans are everywhere and you won’t find a more passionate
        or devoted fanbase, ready to debate, defend, or recap. Check out the
        video below to see just how far viewers have gone to demonstrate their
        love for the series. We’re not saying you have to dress up like the
        <b> Mother of Dragons</b>, but at least you know you’ll have a go-to for
        dinner conversation.
      </p>
      <li><b>No more FOMO.</b></li>
      <p>
        “Winter is here.” “Hold the door.” “You know nothing, Jon Snow.”
        Although the series has ended, its place in pop culture and social media
        holds steady, which likely means phrases and memes you don’t yet
        understand. But the solution is simple: Start watching now and insert
        these iconic phrases into your daily vernacular.
      </p>
      <li><b>Game of Thrones is where many careers began.</b></li>
      <p>
        Emilia Clarke, Kit Harington, Richard Madden, Sophie Turner ... the list
        goes on. Thrones’ ensemble cast featured well-known actors (Sean Bean,
        Peter Dinklage, etc.), but also launched the careers of now-familiar
        favorites.
      </p>
      <li><b>It’s worth the hype.</b></li>
      <p>
        If the number of Emmys the show has garnered isn’t telling enough (59,
        but who’s counting?), the series has its reputation for a reason.
        Whether it’s a new crush, drinking buddy, inspiration or hero, Game of
        Thrones has a character who’s guaranteed to become your new obsession.

      <li><b>Watching without fear of spoilers is very freeing.</b></li>
